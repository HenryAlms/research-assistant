Finished code. Previously submitted two folders of old code. 

My first attempt was more reactively and started off using react simply because I wasn't thinking. 
Following that, I started trying to use firebase for improved storage across users & devices, but I then realized I 
overextended myself and finished up these last two days recreating everything in a more simply MVC style framework.
