A Chrome Extension to assist with researching and organizing sources

Built by Henry Alms

The purpose of this plugin is to help students and researchers store sources for citations while performing their research. It can be easy to forget where sources are from after breaking between projects, and simply pasting links in a document isn't as accessible as it should be. 

To use this app, all that is required is to install the plugin from the Chrome Extensions store. It is free for anyone to use.

To start tracking sources, you must create and name a new project first. Following the creation of the project, you will be allowed to select "New Source" where you will be prompted for information regarding the "Title" of the source, the URL, and other basic info you may wish to incluce. After submitting the work, the link to the source will be stored directly below the project.
